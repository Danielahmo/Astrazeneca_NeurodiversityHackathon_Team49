# Graphic Interface: Simulation of Hardware and Display of Eye-Tracking Algoritm

This interface was coded with Matlab App Designer. The zip file team049_interface contains the .mlapp file (Design and Code), as well as the required
photos and videos for the Design View and for the Eye-Tracking Display. In the zipe file, a .mlappinstall file is also included. This file allows the 
user to test out the inputs of the simulated fidgeting device after 'turning it on' and the correspondent alerts that this'll generate as a Matlab App. 
An exemplary processed video for the eye-tracking algorithm is also displayed after pressing the "Video" button.
