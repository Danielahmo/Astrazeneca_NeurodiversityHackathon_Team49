# Eye tracking algorithm

This a Matlab (R) code for processing the video. Due to the short time we only proved the algorithm in a video with a face from one of the members of the team. The face is not moving, only the eyes. 
The video you can also found it here. 
The program also need an image called 'referencia.jpg' which is the reference, in the real case it would be the calibration that is made at the beginning.
