# Hackathon Embracing Neurodiversity from Astrazeneca, team 49

This is the project resulted form the Hackathon Embracing Neurodivesity from Astrazeneca. We are the team 49 integrated by:

* Pedro Esteban Chavarr√≠as Solano
* Daniela Fernanda Orozco Granados
* Valeria Cruz Tamayo
* Daniela Herrera Montes de Oca

We focused on Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but it can be applied to any attention disorder, which is common in the neurodiversity community. 
Our solution consists of an aiding intelligent system for attention disorders during work on a computer.

Our solution consists of an intelligent system that receives two types of inputs, in one side the webcam of the computer process the image for eye tracking. The other input is the signal received by the fidgetting device design for anxiety and focusing. These inputs are processed by a machine learning model since each person is different, this means that it needs to be trained for adapting to the person. In the computer, an app will show messages when low attention levels are detected. In the end, it will ask the user, on a scale, how much attention does he consider that he paid.
