This is the project resulted form the Hackathon Embracing Neurodivesity from Astrazeneca. We are the team 49 integrated by:

* Pedro Esteban Chavarr√≠as Solano
* Daniela Fernanda Orozco Granados
* Valeria Cruz Tamayo
* Daniela Herrera Montes de Oca

We focused on Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but it can be applied to any attention disorder, which is common in the neurodiversity community. 
Our solution consists of an aiding intelligent system for attention disorders during work on a computer.
